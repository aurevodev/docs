# API Reference

The Aurevo API adheres to the REST architecture. Our interface boasts resource-oriented URLs with a clear structure, allowing for form-encoded request bodies and JSON-encoded responses. The use of standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs contribute to the predictability and robustness of our API.
