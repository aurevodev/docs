# Errors

Aurevo follows the customary convention of using standard HTTP response codes to convey the outcome of an API request. As a general rule, HTTP status codes in the range of 2xx signify a successful operation. HTTP status codes in the range of 4xx indicate that the API request failed due to errors that can be attributed to the information provided, such as an absent required parameter. Rarely, HTTP status codes in the 5xx range imply an error related to Aurevo's servers.

## HTTP Status Codes
Aurevo's API uses standard HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. Below are some of the most commonly used status codes:

| Code | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| 200  | OK - The request was successful. |
| 400  | Bad Request - The request was invalid or could not be understood, often due to missing a required parameter. |
| 401  | Unauthorized - Authentication failed or no valid API key was provided. |
| 402  | Request Failed - The request was valid but failed to complete for an unknown reason. |
| 403  | Forbidden - The authenticated user does not have access to the requested resource. |
| 404  | Not Found - The requested resource does not exist. |
| 409  | Conflict - The request conflicts with another request. |
| 429  | Too Many Requests - Too many requests have been sent in a given amount of time. |
| 500, 502, 503, 504  | Server Errors - Something went wrong on the server side. These errors are rare. |

## Error Types
- `api_error` - API errors cover any other type of problem (e.g., a temporary problem with Aurevo's servers), and are extremely uncommon.
- `invalid_request_error` - Invalid request errors arise when your request has invalid parameters.
