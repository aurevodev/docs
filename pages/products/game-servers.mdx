Get ready for an exceptional gaming experience with our high-performance
servers. Whether you're a passionate Minecraft enthusiast or enjoy other popular
games, our service ensures smooth gameplay and seamless interactions with your
gaming community.

## Getting Started

Getting started with our same servers is quick and easy. Just follow these
simple steps:

<Steps>
### Step 1 - Register
 
Register an account if you haven't already.

### Step 2 - Log in to the dashboard

Log in to our dashboard using your registered credentials.

### Step 3 - Add a Payment Method via Billing Tab

To prevent spam, we require users to add a payment method before creating a
server. Upon creating a server, we will charge for the monthly subscription.
Don't worry, if you are unsatisfied with the product, you can request a refund
within 48 hours of purchasing.

### Step 4 - Deploy Your Server

After adding a payment method, head back to the dashboard and click on the
"Servers" tab. Then, click "Deploy in Seconds." Select your preferred server
software, server name, region, plan and click deploy. If you try to create a
server without adding a card, you will see a prompt asking you to add a payment
method.

If everything goes smoothly, your server will be deployed to your specified
region within seconds and will appear in the "Servers" tab.

### Step 5 - Access Server Management Panel

Click the server that appears in the "Servers" tab, then click "Manage." You
will be directed to our server management panel. The login credentials for this
panel were emailed to you when you first logged in.

### Step 6 - Enjoy Gaming!

Now you can enjoy your game with your friends or community. If you encounter any
issues, please open a ticket in our Discord community for prompt support.
