## Details

As we continue to refine our Database service, we have made it available in
public beta. This means you can already experience its benefits. However, please
be **mindful** that, as with any beta service, there might be occasional updates
and improvements being made.

**Important**: **Avoid using our databases for critical production data** during
this beta phase, as there may be potential risks and limitations.

We value your feedback and encourage you to share your thoughts with us. Your
input plays a vital role in shaping the future of our Database service for its
official release.

## Important Notice

We want to be fully transparent about our Database service to ensure you make
informed decisions. Please note the following important details:

- **No SLAs**: Our databases are provided without Service Level Agreements
  (SLAs), meaning we do not guarantee specific levels of uptime or availability.

- **Limited Availability**: Our databases are not highly available, which means
  there may be potential downtime or interruptions in service.

- **Scaling Limits**: Database scaling is limited and will only expand according
  to the resources available within your chosen plan.

- **Mission-Critical Considerations**: We want to emphasize that our database
  service is not recommended for anything mission-critical, such as applications
  that handle financial transactions or sensitive data like those required for
  starting a bank.

We value the trust you place in us, and it's essential for you to understand the
limitations and considerations of our datasbase service. If you require a more
robust and secure solution for critical applications, we recommend exploring
other options that provide higher availability and additional guarantees.
