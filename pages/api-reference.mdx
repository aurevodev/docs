# Aurevo REST API

---

Aurevo REST API allows developers to interact programmatically with their Aurevo
account and services using HTTP requests.

The API supports any programming language or framework that can send HTTP
requests.

You can use the commands listed below with `curl` by providing your token.

## API Basics

Our API is exposed as an HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 service over TLS. All endpoints live
under the URL https://api.aurevo.us and then generally follow the REST
architecture.

### Content Type

All requests must be encoded as JSON with the Content-Type: `application/json`
header. If not otherwise specified, responses from the Aurevo API, including
errors, are encoded exclusively as JSON as well.

### Authentication

Aurevo Access Tokens are required to authenticate and use the API.

```js filename="index.js" copy
  Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>
```

### Errors

All API endpoints follow a consistent format for error responses to ensure a
clear communication.

Our error response structure consists of the following fields:

```json filename="error.json" copy
{
  "error": "Not authorized",
  "message": "FORBIDDEN",
  "statusCode": 403
}
```

While we recommend that you write error messages that fit your needs and provide
your users with the best experience, our error fields are designed to not
contain sensitive information, and can be safely passed down to user interfaces.

### Versioning

To ensure seamless communication and compatibility with our API, we always
include the current version information in the `API-Version` request header.

### Rate Limits

We limit the number of calls you can make over a certain period of time. Rate
limits vary and are specified by the following header in all responses:

| Header                  | Description                                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `X-Ratelimit-Limit`     | The maximum number of requests that the consumer is permitted to make.       |
| `X-Ratelimit-Remaining` | The number of requests remaining in the current rate limit window.           |
| `X-Ratelimit-Reset`     | The time at which the current rate limit window resets in UTC epoch seconds. |

### Request IDs

Every API request you make is assigned a unique request identifier for easy
tracking and troubleshooting. This identifier can be found in the response
headers under X-Request-Id. In the rare event that you encounter an issue with
our service, providing this request identifier to our support team will expedite
the resolution process, allowing us to quickly pinpoint and address any concerns
you may have.
